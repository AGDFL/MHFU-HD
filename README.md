# MHFU-HD

**Disclaimer: the item icons are not made by me, they are done by [GeneStarwind](https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Images_GeneStarwind), so kudos to him for the fantastic job! I just added a few of the missing ones. That file is not yet complete. Other than that, the UI elements (aside from some of the status icons which are done by [GeneStarwind](https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Images_GeneStarwind)) are all edited or done from scratch.**

- I am aware most people won't know what to do with these so for those that have never used custom textures in PPSSPP I will add a tutorial on how to use them soon, when I get some free time.
- With the release of Monster Hunter Generations (Ultimate) we now have access to HD textures of most of the Monster Hunter Freedom Unite monsters and mobs. I highly encourage you to find packs that have HD textures for the monsters. There is at least one floating around and it makes the game look way better.
- PPSSPP by default does NOT use the original PSP font due to copyright issues. Find tutorials on Youtube on how to do get the default font in PPSSPP, it makes the text in the game look way better.

- I also made all the intro screens from scratch, using hires images I found on the internet for backgrounds (including a fantastic hires image of the loading screen). You can find all of them in the Intro folder
