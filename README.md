# MHFU-HD

**Disclaimer: the item icons are not made by me, they are done by [GeneStarwind](https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Images_GeneStarwind), so kudos to him for the fantastic job! I just added a few of the missing ones. That file is not yet complete. Other than that, the UI elements (aside from some of the status icons which are done by [GeneStarwind](https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Images_GeneStarwind)) are all edited or done from scratch.**

Plenty of people have released packs that make MHFU look better but I haven't yet found on that changes the UI too much so I took that upon myself as I still play this game but wanted it to look a bit better too.

- With the release of Monster Hunter Generations (Ultimate) we now have access to HD textures of most of the Monster Hunter Freedom Unite monsters and mobs. I highly encourage you to find packs that have HD textures for the monsters. There is at least one floating around and it makes the game look way better.

- PPSSPP by default does NOT use the original PSP font due to copyright issues. Find tutorials on Youtube on how to do get the default font in PPSSPP, it makes the text in the game look way better.

- I also made all the intro screens from scratch, using hires images I found on the internet for backgrounds (including a fantastic hires image of the loading screen). You can find all of them in the Intro folder

**HOW TO USE**:

1. Download repository as zip to keep folder structure
2. Go into your PPSSPP config/memstick folder (**~/.config/ppsspp** for Linux and OSX) and create a folder called TEXTURES
3. Extract the downloaded archive in the TEXTURES folder and rename it after your game ID. It's something like **ULUS10391** for US usually, but check with your own version. This pack has been done against that version of the game, others *may* have different memory addresses bu I haven't checked much into it. If that's the case then using this patch will involve some fiddlign witbh memory dumping and settings editing, I won't cover all that.

At this point before running the game make sure you have a structure like:
PSP/TEXTURES/ULUS10391/settings.ini

PSP/TEXTURES/ULUS10391/UI/Frame

PSP/TEXTURES/ULUS10391/UI/Screens

4. Make sure you have **Replace textures** enabled at the bottom of your Developer tools in PPSSPP (should be on by default)
5. Enjoy the game in slightly more HD :)
